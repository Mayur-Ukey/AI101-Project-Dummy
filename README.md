## Problem and data

- **Goal:** predict whether a team wins a match (win / lose), given the match and team statistics.
- **Dataset:** Basketball Tournament Dataset (Kaggle, a simulated dataset), https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sharmajicoder/basketball-tournament-dataset
- **Size:** [10000 rows, 22 columns]
- **Target column:** Winner
- **Model:** Logistic regression (binary classification)

> **Note on the data:** The dataset is a simulated basketball tournament dataset from Kaggle, not real match records. The results therefore show how the method works, not how well it would predict real NBA or tournament games.

## Setup

Tested on Python 3.14.6 (Windows).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mayur-Ukey-358/AI101-Project.git
cd AI101-Project
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to run

1. Run: `python src/main.py`
2. The script prints the model accuracy and other metrics, and saves plots in `outputs/`.
3. To predict one match: `python src/predict.py`
4. Expected runtime: under [30] seconds.
